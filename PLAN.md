okay what i want you to do is to analyze first the relevant files that  │
│   will shape your understanding more                                      │
│   @lib\models\active_recall_models.dart                                   │
│   @lib\models\study_analytics_models.dart                                 │

│   @lib\services\supabase_service.dart i want you to understand that       │
│   codes and so on to gain understanding so that you will know how we      │
│   handle that becuase its already good in the we are in the module        │
│   details we click start study session we click active recall as our      │
│   study technique then the session begin it is good perfecnt and at the   │
│   last we can get the analytics like you can in the Session Complete      │
│   that we can see a lot of tabs with analytics. i want you as well to     │
│   fetch from supabase mcp server to understand all tables and columns,    │
│   SO OUR NEXT IMPLEMENTATION IF WE CLICK POMODORO AS OUR STUDY TECHNIQUE  │
│   HERE IS THE INFO Implementation:                                        │
│   Launch a built-in Pomodoro timer (e.g., 25 mins study + 5 mins break).  │
│   Lock or minimize distractions during the timer.                         │
│   Encourage students to take notes or complete a quiz at the end of each  │
│   cycle.                                                                  │
│   same from the active recall we still have descriptioev analutics and    │
│   presciprive analytics at the end of the session so plan this you can    │
│   modify the tables or columns or add tables from supabase mcp server
