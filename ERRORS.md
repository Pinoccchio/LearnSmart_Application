# RESOLVED ERRORS - Pomodoro Settings

## Latest Issues (FIXED) - August 25, 2025

### 1. Validation Logic Bug with Equal Durations ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue:** Settings with equal work/break durations (e.g., 30s/30s) were failing validation
**Error:** `Invalid settings: Short break should be shorter than work duration`
**Root Cause:** Overly strict validation rule that didn't allow equal durations for micro-sessions
**Solution:** Updated validation to allow equal durations for sessions ≤30 seconds

### 2. Outdated Error Dialog Design ✅ RESOLVED  
**Issue:** Basic Material AlertDialog didn't match app's modern design system
**Problems:** 
- Plain white background with standard Material styling
- Simple "Error" title with basic "OK" button
- No visual hierarchy or app-consistent colors
- No error categorization or retry functionality
**Solution:** Created ModernErrorDialog component with:
- App-consistent colors and styling using AppColors
- Animated icons and smooth transitions
- Error type categorization (validation, network, permission, general)
- Contextual retry functionality
- Modern rounded corners and shadows
- Proper typography matching app theme

### 3. Missing PomodoroSettings Static Methods ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue:** Widget referenced non-existent static methods
**Missing Methods:**
- `PomodoroSettings.availablePresets`
- `PomodoroSettings.getPreset(String)`  
- `PomodoroSettings.getPresetDisplayName(String)`
- `PomodoroSettings.formatDuration(Duration)`
**Solution:** All methods were already implemented in the model (lines 657-709)

### 4. Settings Not Pre-filled for Existing Users ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue:** Widget always showed default settings instead of user's saved preferences
**Problems:**
- Users had to reconfigure settings every time they opened the widget
- Confusing UX - saved settings weren't reflected in the UI
- No loading state while retrieving user preferences
**Solution:** Enhanced PomodoroSettingsWidget with:
- Automatic loading of user's saved settings from database on initialization
- Professional loading state with spinner and descriptive text
- Fallback to default settings if loading fails
- Clear visual feedback during settings retrieval
